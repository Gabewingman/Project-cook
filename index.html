            <pre id="Trivia">
            Adobong Pusit is a tasty squid dish cooked using the popular Filipino adobo method.<br> is first boiled in soy sauce and vinegar then later sautéed in garlic, onions and tomatoes;<br>this brings in an awesome array of flavors that will surely activate your taste buds.
                <br>
            Technically, any squid will do for this recipe.<br>However, small to medium sized squids are highly recommended because they are more flavorful compared to the large ones.<br> It is hard to find fresh medium squids here in Illinois: this was the reason why I waited until I got to the Philippines to shoot this Adobong Pusit video. <br> was quite a short vacation but I made sure to make the most out of the short time that I got.
