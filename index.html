                <br>
                Adobong Pusit is a tasty squid dish cooked using the popular Filipino adobo method. It is first boiled in soy sauce and vinegar then later sautéed in garlic, onions, and tomatoes; this brings in an awesome array of flavors that will surely activate your taste buds.
                <br><br>
                Technically, any squid will do for this recipe. However, small to medium-sized squids are highly recommended because they are more flavorful compared to the large ones. It is hard to find fresh medium squids here in Illinois: this was the reason why I waited until I got to the Philippines to shoot this Adobong Pusit video. It was quite a short vacation, but I made sure to make the most out of the short time that I got.

                <li>Add the squid and wait for the liquid to re-boil. Simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Turn off the heat then separate the squid from the liquid. Set aside.</li>

                <li>Pour-in the soy sauce-vinegar-water mixture that was used to cook the squid a while back. Bring to a boil and simmer for 3 minutes.</li>

                <li>Share and enjoy! Note: If you want a thicker sauce, remove the squid from the wok or cooking pot and let the sauce boil until enough liquid evaporates. Once done, you may top the squid with the sauce.</li>
